# Bitcraft Bindings

This repo houses [SpaceTimeDB](https://github.com/clockworklabs/SpacetimeDB) SDK bindings for Bitcraft Online.

There are 6 active branches - 3 supported languages (C#, TypeScript, Rust) and 2 modules (global and region).

(Two older branches, global-old and region-old, are no longer updated.)

For more information on how to use these bindings, see https://github.com/BitCraftToolBox
